![NavigateHome AI Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200/0066CC/FFFFFF?text=NavigateHome+AI)

## üåü **Two Complete Platforms in One Repository**

This repository contains **both** a comprehensive web platform and a native iOS app for immigration assistance:

### üåê **Web Platform** (`immigr-aid-platform.html`)
- **Fully functional multilingual web application**
- **8 languages**: English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, French
- **AI-powered form assistance** with OpenAI integration
- **Real immigration forms**: I-821D, I-765, I-131 with native language support
- **Speech-to-text** and comprehensive help resources
- **No installation required** - works in any modern browser



## üí° **The Concept**

NavigateHome AI serves as a 24/7 personal advocate for immigrants, guiding them through legal paperwork, healthcare access, rights protection, translation, and connecting them to verified community resources ‚Äî all in their native language.

## üíî **Why This Is Desperately Needed**

- **High Legal Costs**: Immigration lawyers cost $3,000‚Äì$10,000+ ‚Äî unaffordable for most immigrants
- **Complex Government Systems**: Government websites are intentionally confusing and hard to navigate
- **Critical Mistakes**: Thousands of immigrants miss deadlines, lose cases, or face deportation due to small paperwork mistakes
